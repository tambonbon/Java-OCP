/**
 * If count is an instance of SynchronizedCounter, then making these methods synchronized has two effects:

    * First, it is not possible for two invocations of synchronized methods on the same object to interleave. 
    When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods 
    for the same object block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.
    
    * Second, when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before relationship 
    with any subsequent invocation of a synchronized method for the same object. 
    This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to all threads.
